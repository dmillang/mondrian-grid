                <p class="grid__card__paragraph__text">This composition is a 1930 painting by Piet Mondrian. In it, the author contributes to the abstract visual language. Thick, black brushwork defines the borders of the geometric figures. This black brushwork on the canvas is minimal but also one of the defining features of this work.</p>
